      <description>This website is being built for a capstone project but is also meant to give an idea about some of the hobbies that I have. The Play a Game page allows you to play Snake which is one of the first games that I learned how to make. Additionally, there is a portfolio page that gives you a look into my hobby of photography where you can see some of the pictures that I have taken for various events.</description>
