    <center><h2><u>About Me</u></h2></center>
    <H4>Hello! Iâ€™m Jeremy Drag, a dedicated cybersecurity student at Millikin University with a passion for coding and problem-solving. With a strong academic record, including a 3.98 GPA and numerous honors, I have developed proficiency in languages such as Java, JavaScript, and Python. My experiences range from interning at Constellation Nuclear Power, where I contribute to building efficient database displays, to working in performance consulting, helping clients with web and database solutions. I thrive in fast-paced environments, utilizing my leadership skills to train peers and support users at the Millikin IT Helpdesk. </H4>
   <center><h2><u> What is this website meant for?</u></h2></center>
    <H4>This website is being built for a capstone project but is also meant to give an idea about some of the hobbies that I have. The Play a Game page allows you to play Snake which is one of the first games that I learned how to make. Additionally, there is a portfolio page that gives you a look into my hobby of photography where you can see some of the pictures that I have taken for various events.</H4>
    <H4>The website itself was built using Hugo for a base static website and then I edited the theme accordingly to make it my own.</H4>
